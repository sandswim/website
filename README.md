# Sandgate Storm Swim Club website
This repository contains the source code for the Sandgate Storm Swim Club website online at <http://www.sandswim.com.au>. 

It is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) *static site generator* website which means the source files are pretty much simplified HTML pages - [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)-formatted text files which you can see stored in the [pages/](pages/) folder - which are combined with a very simple template to add headers & footers to all pages and produce the final HTML web pages which are then delivered online with a web server. We are using  [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Jekyll Commands
#### Launch new site
`jekyll new . --force`

#### Serve locally
`bundle exec jekyll serve`
