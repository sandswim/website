For the 2019/2020 season, Brisbane Swimming is running two premiership competitions.

The Junior Premiership is for swimmers 12 years and under only and will be run in one division:

The Premiership competiton is run in a number of divisions, as in previous years. This year, Sandgate is participating in the third division:

--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 	  
Sandgate | 15 | 15 | | | | |	  	  	  	 

With a sport that is largely about individual efforts and individual achievements, participation in Premiership events affords swimmers a chance to compete for their club, building club spirit and contributing to our club's Premiership competition points.

## Club Meets

### 1. Categories of meet

There are three categories of club meet - preparation, transition and development. 

### 2. Rules for Preparation meets

## OME - your responsibilies 

Most swim meets require you to enter online using the Online Meet Entry (OME) system through your Swim Central account. Using the national results database, OME shows the events your swimmer qualifies for and takes payment on-line. OME help page

OME puts the responsibility on you, the swimmer/parent, to keep our club informed. To ensure your swimmer's achievements are acknowledged by our club, you must promptly email me to:

1. advise you have nominated your swimmer for a meet; and

2. forward event information (entries, timelines, timekeeping, programme and results). 

If you do not, your results may not be included in our results and records databases, because, under OME, I am not usually advised by the meet organiser.
