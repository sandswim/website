### Brisbane Premiership 2019/2020

For the 2019/2020 season, Brisbane Swimming is running two premiership competitions.

The Junior Premiership is for swimmers 12 years and under only and will be run in one division: 

Junior | Short Course | Open Water | Relay Champs | Sprint Champs | Junior Champs | Senior Champs | Total
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
Sandgate | | 1 | | | | |

The Premiership competiton is run in a number of divisions, as in previous years. This year, Sandgate is participating in the third division:

Junior | Senior SC | Open Water | Relay Champs | Sprint Champs | Junior Champs | Senior Champs | Total
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- 	  
Sandgate | 15 | 15 | | | | |	  	  	  	 

With a sport that is largely about individual efforts and individual achievements, participation in Premiership events affords swimmers a chance to compete for their club, building club spirit and contributing to our club's Premiership competition points.

## Club Meets

### 1. Categories of meet

There are three categories of club meet - [preparation, transition and development](https://qld.swimming.org.au/about-competition).

### 2. Rules for Preparation meets

Clubs may only compete at the preparation meet to which they have been allocated. [Club meet allocations](https://brisbane.swimming.org.au/Club-Meet-Allocations.aspx?rw=c). Nominations must be submitted by the Swim Central OME system.

QTs recorded at preparation meets may be used for all other meets, including State and National meets. 

### 3. JX Standards 

JX Criteria and standards [2019-2020](files/meets1920/JX-times-2019-2020.pdf)

### 4. Timekeeping at Swim Meets

Sandgate Swim Club is required to provide timekeepers at some meets we attend. If you nominate, you will be expected to timekeep when requested. Please make yourself available. Thanks for your support of our club and your competitive swimmer.

## Swim Central

Swim Central is the new national operating system for clubs and members. 

There is a new and improved streamlined process for nominating for a meet:

1. click [here](files/meets1920/New meet nomination process 26_9_19.pdf) for a step by step guide; and

2. click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNszlormJ80&feature=youtu.be) for a short video.

Further resources, including frequently asked questions, may be found by clicking [here](https://qld.swimming.org.au/swim-central-resources-0).

## OME - your responsibilies 

Most swim meets require you to enter online using the Online Meet Entry (OME) system through your Swim Central account. Using the national results database, OME shows the events your swimmer qualifies for and takes payment on-line. [OME help page](https://issuu.com/swimming_queensland/docs/finding_and_entering_a_meet_online)

OME puts the responsibility on you, the swimmer/parent, to keep our club informed. To ensure your swimmer's achievements are acknowledged by our club, you must promptly [email me](mailto:nominations_sandswim@bigpond.com) to:

1. advise you have nominated your swimmer for a meet; and

2. forward event information (entries, timelines, timekeeping, programme and results). 

If you do not, your results may not be included in our results and records databases, because, under OME, I am not usually advised by the meet organiser.
