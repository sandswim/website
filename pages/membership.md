# Membership & Fees

## Club Membership
All swimmers who use the pool facilities during the official swimming season and attend Club Night must be members of the Sandgate Storm Swimming club and be financial at all times. Club membership fees are charged per-family.

A visitor (non-member) may swim at club night for 3 weeks before they are required to become a financial member.

### Membership Categories
**8 yrs & Older Competative Swimmer** - 8 yrs & older swimmers who wish to compete at any meet in the season.

**All ages Recreational Swimmer** - swimmers of any age wishing to attend Club Night only and not compete in meets.

**Under School Age Swimming Sibling** -  In recognition of the family environment at Club Night, a special category of membership has been created for our smallest swimmers who come along with their older brothers or sisters. To be elidgible for this category, a swimmer must be under school age and be part of a family with a full fee paying member sibling.

**Parent Members** - All parents/guardians of swimmers need to enrol to be covered by the Swimming Qld. insurance. Parent/guardian membership is free.
