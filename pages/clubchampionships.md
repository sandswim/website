### Club Championship rules
For 25m + events, no rule tolerances apply. A one start rule applies. All events are swum as heats only, with places based on the judge's adjudication and the judge's decision is final.
For 12.5m events, there will be rule tolerance - this means it is not necessary for these swimmers to be technically correct, but they must start in a fair manner. 12.5m swimmers must hang on to the bar and not leave the wall until the start gun sounds.

More information about rules can be found [here](files/Basic%20guide%20and%20rules.pdf) and [here](files/rules%20for%20club%20championships.pdf).

### Awards and Records
First, second and third places will be awarded for each competitive age group, stroke and distance category. In each age-competitive event, competitors can accrue points towards age champion according to their place. Swimmers in Open and 12.5m events can accrue points toward Open Champion and Age Champion. 

Points are awarded as follows:

* **5** points for 1st
* **3** points for 2nd
* **1** point for 3rd

Age Champion medals and certificates for swimmers who break club and championship records will be awarded on Trophy Night. Age Champions are awarded to the boy and girl swimmer gaining the most points across all events in their age group. The age group events are 25m or 50m in each of the four strokes (free, back, breast and fly) and either the 100m or 200m medley. 

Please email <nominations_sandswim@bigpond.com> if you need to know anything else.
