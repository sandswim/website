An adult must supervise swimmers under the age of 18 years. Shold clarification be required regarding this requirement, please contact a member of the Club's Committee. The Club is a small club that requires the help of every family. Ther eare many jobs to be done  and without the help of parents, club nihgts and chanmpionshps would be impossible to run. Timekeeping, the canteen etc., are just a couple of the jobs that require several parent helpers each club night.

We will be setting up and distributing a roster and will be asking all families to assist to spread the load so that everyone can enjoy the club and cheer on our swimmers.

Of course, if unforseen circumstances do not permit your family to help on a particular night, we ask you to provide sufficient notice so that replacement volunteers can be found, and we will assist in the rescheduling of volunteer efforts. The Committee bnelieves that by sharing the load, we will be able to run the club smoothly and efficiently.

## Club History
Sandgate Swimming Club Inc. was founded in 1924. Starting life as the *Sandgate Amateure Swimming Club*, members competed in the Shorncliffe pier baths. In those early days, swimmers had to compete with rough weather and jellyfish! The club stayed there until around 1927 when they moved to the new pool built on Flinders Parade. In about 1969, that pool was demolished to make way for a redevelopment. Until that was finished the club made a temporary home at Banyo High School, moving back to the new Sandgate Olympic Pool for the 1973-74 season. The club was incorporated on the 15th December 1998. At the end of the 1993-94 season, a change in the lessee of the Olympic Pool and a growing commercialisation of the ppol into a recreational aquatic centre, saw the club reviewing its options. This meant from the 1995-96 season, a new home was found for the club at the Sandgate State School War Memorial Swimming Pool. Apart from a few competition meets held at the Sandgate High School pool, we've been here ever since. 
- Extract from "Sandgate Swimmin Club - a Brief History" by Reg Morrison, President 1982 - 1986, included in the monthly Club Newsletter, Issue 4, December 2012.

The Club leases from Sandgate State School the six-lane, 25 metre, heated, swimming pool facility located on Keogh Street, Sandgate. In pursuit of its objective to encourage and promote the art of swimming in all of its diciplines in the district of Sandgate, the club promotes strong links with the pre-school and primary school community in the Sandgate distrct and they are reflected in the Club's sizable junior membership.
- From Sandswim Annual Report, 2013

Our first President, according to records, was Mr F.B. Goodwin. Many notable people have held this position, including Mr G.J. Allpass, for whom Allpass Parage in Shorncliffe is named. Sadly, as records have been lost over time, it is not possible to compile a full list of all past Presidents of the club.

Jim Murdoch is the club's number one supporter and has served on the Committee at various times. 

> In the 1950s, I learned to swim at the Sandgate Swimming Club and continued swimming with the club at weekly club meets and representative events until 1966

he says. 

> I originally swum the mile in the old saltwater pool, which was located off the rock wall near the end of the Fourth Avenue and although the records for that era have been lost, I clearly remember being awarded the winner's pennant for the Ppen Mile in the 1964/65 season.

Jim's daughter Anneli also swum with the club.
