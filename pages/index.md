# Sandgate Storm swim club is now on Facebook!

## Just search for "Sandgate Storm"

We won't be posting race results to the website anymore as that's all being taken care of by the Swim Club phone app that we are using.

While we will be reimplementing all the content that was here on Facebook and perhaps elsewhere, information about the Club in general, including the (almost a centuary of) history of the club is still available here:
