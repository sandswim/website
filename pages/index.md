## Welcome

The Committee of Sandgate Swimming welcome all returning swimmers, their parents and supporters to another enjoyable and successful season.  A special welcome to all our new members – we feel sure it will not be long before you feel a part of our friendly club.

Your Committee asks that you read this website as it contains a comprehensive outline of club rules as well as important information.  Parents and supporters are most welcome to discuss with the Committee any matters relating to club policies and activities.  

We  ask all parents to support us by volunteering whenever possible to spread the workload at all club activities.  

Our aim is to encourage all members from learn to swim to senior squad to achieve their maximum potential and personal goals whilst maintaining a social and friendly club environment.  The club coaches will be pleased to discuss swimmers progress with parents.
