# New Website

## Our website is now provided by Sandgate State School:

* <https://sandgatess.eq.edu.au/our-community/pandc/sandgate-state-school-amateur-swim-club>

# Facebook

## Sandgate Storm swim club is also now on Facebook! 

## Just search for "Sandgate Storm"

# Results

We won't be posting race results on the web website anymore as that's all being taken care of by the Swim Club phone app that we are using.

# Club History 

While we will be reimplementing all the content that was here on the State School site and Facebook, information about the Club in general, including the (almost a century of) history of the club is still available here:
